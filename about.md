I'm a research professor at Yoon Lab in the Institute of Gachon Genomic Medicine and Science on the Gachon University Gil Medical Center, South Korea from Jan. 2016. I do computational modeling based on informatics and statistics (information theory, machine learning, and artificial intelligence) to analyze large volumes of high-throughput transcriptomic, sequencing, and other omics data for therapeutic candidate gene discovery, especially in cancer.
